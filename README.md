# Sliding Puzzle Using Hill Climbing Search Algorithm  

->Overview  
This project implements an interactive **Sliding 8 Puzzle game** with two solving modes:  
1. **Manual Mode**: Players solve the puzzle using arrow key controls.  
2. **Algorithm Mode**: The program uses the **Hill Climbing Search Algorithm** with **Manhattan Distance** as the heuristic to solve the puzzle.  

->Features  
1. **Randomized Start**  
- The initial state is randomly generated and ensures solvability using an **inversion count algorithm**.  

2. **Turtle Graphics**  
- Visual representation of the puzzle, tiles, and movements, creating an engaging user experience.  

3. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**  
- Automates puzzle-solving by attempting to minimize the **Manhattan Distance** heuristic.  

4. **Key Bindings**  
- Enables intuitive user interaction for manual solving using arrow keys.  

5. **Visual Feedback**  
- Displays the current state of the puzzle and updates the screen in real-time.  

 ->Strengths  

a. **Interactivity**  
- Manual mode provides a **user-friendly interface** for solving the puzzle.  
- Algorithm mode demonstrates a basic **AI solution** to the problem.  

b. **Robust State Management**  
- State is represented as a 2D list, simplifying operations on tile positions.  
- A solvability check ensures that the initial state always reaches the goal.  

c. **Visualization**  
- Turtle graphics make the puzzle **visually appealing**.  
- Side-by-side display of the **current puzzle** and **goal state** helps track progress.  

d. **Heuristic-Based Search**  
- Uses the **Manhattan Distance heuristic**, efficiently guiding the algorithm closer to the solution.  

->Limitations  

a. **Algorithm Limitations**  
- **Local Minima**: The Hill Climbing algorithm can get stuck in a local minimum, stopping progress even if the puzzle isn't solved.  
- **No Backtracking**: Once a move is made, the algorithm cannot revert to previous states, potentially leading to deadlocks.  

b. **Fixed Puzzle Size**  
- The current implementation is limited to a 3x3 puzzle and cannot dynamically handle other sizes (e.g., 4x4).  

c. **Limited Feedback**  
- When the algorithm gets stuck, feedback ("Algorithm Stuck!") is displayed but does not provide options to retry or exit gracefully.  

->Performance  
- The Hill Climbing algorithm is **efficient for small puzzles** due to its simplicity.  
- However, it struggles with **complex puzzles** as it relies on local decisions and lacks global optimization.  

->Recommendations for Improvement  
a. **Algorithm Enhancement**  
- Implement **Simulated Annealing**: Introduce a probability of making non-optimal moves to avoid local minima.  
- Add **A* Search Algorithm**: Ensure optimality and completeness by exploring all paths systematically.

b. **Dynamic Puzzle Size**  
- Allow dynamic puzzle sizes (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).  
- Update the `create_random_state()` function and goal state generation to handle variable sizes.  

c. **Improved User Interaction**  
- Add a **retry option** when the algorithm fails.  
- Allow users to input a custom starting state or puzzle size.  

d. **Visualization Enhancements**  
- **Animate tile movements** during manual mode for a smoother user experience.  
- Highlight tiles moved by the algorithm to make its process clearer.  

e. **Code Structure**  
- Modularize the code further, separating visualization, logic, and algorithms into distinct functions or files for better maintainability.  

->Suggested Extensions  
1. **Hint System**  
   - Provide hints for manual mode using the heuristic function.  

2. **Scoring Mechanism**  
   - Introduce a scoring system based on the number of moves in manual mode.  

3. **AI Comparison**  
   - Implement multiple AI algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, A*) to allow performance comparison.  

4. **Customization**  
   - Add options for customizing tile colors, font sizes, and screen dimensions.

->Conclusion  
This implementation is an excellent example of combining interactivity with basic AI for solving puzzles. While the **Hill Climbing Algorithm** is a good starting point, addressing its limitations could significantly enhance its performance and usability.  

The game is both **engaging** and **educational**, making it a great tool for learning about **heuristics**, **state-space exploration**, and **problem-solving techniques**.
